      "I'm sure you've been there or thereabouts in your own way, but there may come a time when you succumb to self-doubt and find it hard to crawl out of that place. What that place does is not let you be; it begins to feed off you and nibble at the qualities that set you apart. I have had that phase subconsciously, consistently linger on for an anxiety-inducing two or more years and while I kept dreaming about the same things that I had grown up wishing for, my motivation to do something about them was damaged, and this realisation would stare me in my face right when it truly mattered.",
